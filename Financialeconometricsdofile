//These data do not contain observations for weekends and are missing for U.S. holidays.
//We may not want to drop the observations containing missing data, though,
//as we may have complete data for other variables: for instance, exchange rate data
//are available every day. If there were no missing data in our series—only missing
//observations—we could use Drukker’s suggestion and generate seqdate = n.

//The variable seqdate is created as the sequential day number for every nonmissing day
//and is itself missing when DTB3 is missing—allowing us to use this variable in tsset
//and then use time-series operators (see [U] 11.1.1 varlist) in generate or estimation
//commands such as regress. We may want to display the transformed data (or results
//from estimation, such as predicted values) on a time-series graph. We can just revert
//to the other tsset:

// generate the variable by taking the difference
